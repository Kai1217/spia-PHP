Suicide is a serious issue and we aim to help people who are in need.

Suicide Prevention Inititave Australia was founded by a group of four teenagers from Indooroopilly State High School in Australia.

The two software developers, Kai Matolat (@Kai1217) and Oliver Strong (@OllieLollie1) are currently developing a convolutional neural network in the Python Language.

With this, we aim to lower the amount of suicides that occur in the next forseeable future.
